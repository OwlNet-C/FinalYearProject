<h1 align="center">Detecting Online abuse on Twitter using Machine learning and Lexicon approaches</h1>

<p align="center">
    For my Final Year Project i decided to attempt a soloution for abuse on twitter. I decided to opt for a machine learning method that would use existing datasets to try and create an automated approach. I grasped the use of python techniques like Natural Language Processing, Machine learning pipelines, and sentiment analysis. As i progressed through my research i also attempted to evaluate a completely new proposed method that would utilise text classification and combine with a lexicon. This lead to my project evaluating 3 separate methods. I was able to achieve a first class honours through my effort achieving a 78. Below you can find my supervisors assessment of the overall project.
